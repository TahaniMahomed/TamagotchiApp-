The Tamagotchi App a digital pet simulation game that offers a exciting and engaging experience for users. It allows you to take care of your own virtual pet by feeding it, playing with it, and ensuring it well-being. It provides a sense of responsibility for your own virtual pet and keeps you amused. The app's interface is user-friendly and attainable to all people of different ages and abilities. Additionally, it is optimized for various devices and screen sizes, enabling you to play the game anytime and anywhere. The Tamagotchi App was developed using GitHub and GitHub Actions, which makes it more efficient and reliable. The Tamagotchi App consists of two main activities namely MainActivity and MainActivity2. MainActivity serves as the starting point of the app and includes a start button that directs users to the main game screen which is Activity main 2 upon clicking the button. The startButton is initialized by finding the view with the ID startButton from the layout. A click listener is set on the startButton to handle user clicks. When clicked, it creates an Intent to navigate to MainActivity2 and starts the activity MainActivity2 represents the main game screen where users interact with their virtual pet. This code represents MainActivity2 of your Tamagotchi app, where users interact with their virtual pet. It imports necessary packages and libraries for Android app development. The MainActivity2 class inherits from AppCompatActivity also . It declares variables for petImageView, to display the pet image, and three variables which are health, cleanliness, happiness to store thes pets status. Click listeners for each button update the petImageView based on the action ,feeding, cleaning, or playing. The updatePetStatus method updates pet status (health, cleanliness) based on the action performed. updateProgressBars method is intended to update progress bars, but currently is a placeholder. The R.drawable references are placeholders for actual resource IDs corresponding to pet images. I hope that you enjoy playing the Tamagotchi App and reliving the nostalgic Tamagotchi experience.
